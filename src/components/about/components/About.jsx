          <p>
            The National Centre for Energy Research and Development, University
            of Nigeria, Nsukka was established by an Act of the National

            at Nsukka started operation fully in 1982. The Federal Government
            later established Energy Commission of Nigeria through decrees
            number 12 of 1988 and number 19 of 1989 and charged it with the
            legal mandate of supervising the four Centres.
